            <b>Morgan Ryan is 16, and she's currently a junior at Westside High School. She joined Teen Council because she believes that everyone deserves to know how to keep themselves healthy and safe. And yet, schools are not required to teach any form of sex education in Nebraska. There are some really phenomenal resources for sexually-active teens in this state, but a lot of people don’t know about them. Being able to help her peers access the healthcare that they need is very rewarding to her.</b>

            <b>Amanda Hingorani (she/her/hers) is a senior at Marian High School.  Amanda joined Teen Council because it is such a unique opportunity for teenagers to get involved in their community while becoming equipped with necessary information and resources.  She believes that sexual health is incorporated into and is just as important as mental and physical health, and that sexual education is crucial to a healthy lifestyle.  Despite how important Sex Ed is, Amanda is aware that it continues to fall at the bottom of the list for conversation topics.  Due to this unpopularity, Amanda is dedicated to erasing the stigma around talking about sexual education and believes it should be normalized!  This is Amanda’s first year on Teen Council and she is excited to learn from experts and to be a resource among her peers.  Along with Teen Council, Amanda is an active member of her school’s speech team, year-round volunteer at the Omaha Public Library, and a member of the Kim Foundation’s Youth Advisory Council for mental health awareness and suicide prevention.

         <p>Kati Kough (she/her/hers) is a Health Educator for Planned Parenthood North Central States, where she
provides sex education to teenagers, young adults, and professionals throughout the Omaha
community. She cofacilitates the Omaha Teen Council program, which educates high schoolers on topics
such as Birth Control, STIs/HIV, Health Dating, Gender and Sexuality, Communication Skills, Pregnancy
Options, Presentations Skills, Values, and many more. In addition, Kati provides informational sessions
about GetCheckedOmaha, a program that provides completely free and confidential birth control, STI
testing, and STI treatment throughout Nebraska. She also facilitates the AskableAdults Matter training
to local adults and youth-serving professionals who want to learn to be resources and trusted adults for
           the young people in their lives.
      She believes in providing information, tools, and access to young people
so they can make important decisions about their lives in empowered and healthy ways. Before working
at Planned Parenthood, Kati earned her master’s and bachelor’s in Sociology at the University of
Nebraska at Omaha, where she focused her research on pornography, sexual identity formation,
transgender experiences, menstruation, and abortion. When Kati isn’t thinking about sex, she’s probably
cooking with lots of butter, petting one of her cats, watering her plants, or working on a cross stitch!
